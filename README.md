# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku solver group project for Artificial Intelligence

This is a sudoku solver that uses recursive backtracking to find a solution.

The solver is in [solver.cs](Sudoku/Assets/Scripts/solver.cs), which interacts with [board.cs](Sudoku/Assets/Scripts/board.cs). The board itself interacts with Unity's UI system to dislpay the board.

A pc build can be found at [this folder](Sudoku/Builds/pc_build_1/). You need the entire build folder (pc_build_1) downloaded onto your computer to run it. Run Sudoku.exe

This uses the latest stable version of Unity, which is Unity 2020.1.14f1
To run in Unity, download this repository, and open the "Sudoku" folder with Unity.
